# Game Card Integration Documentation

## Overview
This document details the changes made to integrate the PokerGameCard component with Firebase to display real game data instead of mock data. The integration ensures that authenticated users can view their game history with accurate statistics.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Data Types and Interfaces
- Added `GameCardData` and `PlayerDetail` interfaces to `types.d.ts` for use in the PokerGameCard component
- Added Firebase `GameDoc` and `PlayerStats` interfaces to represent the data structure in Firestore

### 2. Added Firebase Utility Functions
- Added `fetchUserGames`: Fetches all games where a specific user was a participant
- Added `transformGameDataForCard`: Transforms Firestore game data into the format expected by the PokerGameCard component
- Added `getUsernameByUID`: Retrieves a user's username from their UID

### 3. Updated PokerGameCard Component
- Removed hardcoded sample data
- Modified the component to use the GameCardData interface from types.d.ts
- Ensured the component can properly display real game data

### 4. Updated Game History Page
- Added state for games, loading, error, and username
- Added functionality to fetch the user's username from Firebase
- Added functionality to fetch and transform games for the authenticated user
- Implemented proper loading and error states
- Added an empty state for when no games are found
- Updated the UI to conditionally render game cards based on fetched data

## Implementation Details

### Firebase Data Flow
1. User authentication via useAuth hook
2. Fetch the user's username using getUsernameByUID
3. Fetch all games where the user participated using fetchUserGames
4. Transform the game data to a format compatible with the PokerGameCard component using transformGameDataForCard
5. Display the transformed data in the UI

### Function Details

#### fetchUserGames
This function:
- Takes a username as input
- Queries the 'games' collection in Firestore
- Filters for games where the user's username is in the playerUsernames array
- Returns an array of game documents with their IDs
- Sorts games by creation date (newest first)

#### transformGameDataForCard
This function:
- Takes a game document, game ID, and current username as input
- Calculates total pot size from player buy-ins
- Calculates the current user's performance statistics:
  - Buy-in amount
  - Winnings/losses
  - ROI (Return on Investment)
- Creates player detail objects for each player in the game
- Formats the date from the Firestore timestamp
- Returns a GameCardData object compatible with the PokerGameCard component

#### getUsernameByUID
This function:
- Takes a user's UID as input
- Queries the 'players' collection for the user's document
- Returns the username field from the player document

## Data Modifications
The following data transformations occur during this process:

1. Firestore Game Document → GameCardData:
   - Game metadata (name, creation date, etc.)
   - Player statistics calculation (buy-ins, winnings, ROI)
   - Player list transformation to detail-rich format
   - User-specific calculations (current user's performance)

2. User Auth → Username Resolution:
   - Firebase Auth User object → User UID
   - User UID → Username (from players collection)

## Future Improvements
Potential improvements to consider:
- Implement pagination for users with many games
- Add sorting and filtering options for the game history view
- Enhance player statistics with historical trends
- Display player first names instead of usernames when available

## Technical Debt
Current limitations to address in future updates:
- Error handling could be more granular
- Need to implement proper loading states and skeleton UI

## Recent Updates (Latest)
### Game Duration Implementation
- **Implemented**: Game duration tracking using the `gameDuration` field from Firestore
- **Fixed**: Hardcoded duration values (previously set to 2h 30m) now use actual game data
- **Enhanced**: Duration conversion from minutes to hours/minutes format
- **Added**: "Active" status display for in-progress games
- **Improved**: Currency symbol consistency across all card elements
- **Enhanced**: Proper handling of winnings/ROI display for active vs completed games
